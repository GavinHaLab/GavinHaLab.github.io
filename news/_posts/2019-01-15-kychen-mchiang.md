A warm welcome to new lab members [Katharine Chen](/people/Katharine-Chen/) and Megan Chiang. 

[Katharine](/people/Katharine-Chen/) joins us as a graduate rotation student in the [MCB Program](https://mcb-seattle.edu/) for this winter semester. She will be investigating approaches to analyze cell-free DNA from advanced cancer patients.

Megan join us as a bioinformatics intern from Northeastern University where she is completing her MSc. She will be analyzing tumor whole genome sequencing data from castration-resistant prostate cancer. 

We are excited for them to start working on these exciting projects.
