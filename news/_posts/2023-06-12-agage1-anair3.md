We are excited to welcome [Addison Gage](/people/visitor/Addie-Gage/) and [Akira Nair](/people/visitor/Akira-Nair) who join the lab as summer research interns in computational biology. 

Addison will work on implementing the lab's tools into the cloud environment and exploring maching learning approaches for cancer genomics. 

Akira is part of the Fred Hutch Summer Undegraduate Research Program (SURP). He will be applying genomic analyses and deep learning approaches to analyze circulating tumor DNA.
