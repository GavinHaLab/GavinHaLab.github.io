Congratulations to [Anat Zimmer](/people/postdoc/Anat-Zimmer/) on receiving a Trainee Grant from the [Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine](https://brotmanbaty.org/){:target="_blank"}. 

[Anat's](/people/postdoc/Anat-Zimmer/) project will involve the study of androgen receptor splice variants in prostate cancer using circulating tumor DNA. She will use computational and machine learning approaches to develop a signature for predicting ARv7 status.
