Congratulations to [Robert Patton](/people/postdoc/Robert-Patton/) on receiving a [2023 Prostate Cancer Foundation Young Investigator Award](https://www.pcf.org/c/young-investigator-award-class-of-2023/){:target="_blank"}. 

[Robert's](/people/postdoc/Robert-Patton/) project titled ["Non-Invasive Prediction of Tumor Phenotypes, Therapeutic Targets, and Treatment Response in CRPC using ctDNA"](https://www.pcf.org/c/young-investigator-award-class-of-2023/){:target="_blank"} proposes to develop novel computational approaches to study of prostate cancer phenotypes and treatment response using liquid biopsies. The outcome of his work will have important applications in tumor monitoring, predictive biomarker discovery, and diagnostics for men with advanced prostate cancer.
