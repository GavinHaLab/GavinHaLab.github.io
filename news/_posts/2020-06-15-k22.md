We are very grateful to the [NCI](https://www.cancer.gov/) for supporting Dr. Gavin Ha with a Transition Career Development Award (K22). This award will help support his research for the next 3 years to develop computational methods for emerging technologies to analyze tumor and cell-free DNA and will provide insights into the mechanisms underpinning treatment resistance in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The K22 award will allow Gavin to further develop his scientific, professional, and leadership skills and prepare him to become a well-rounded independent investigator, leading a multi-disciplinary cancer research group.
