We are very grateful to the [NCI](https://www.cancer.gov/) for supporting Dr. Gavin Ha with the [2022 NIH Director's New Innovator Award](https://commonfund.nih.gov/newinnovator/AwardRecipients){:target="_blank"}. This award will help support Ha Lab research for the next 5 years to develop computational methods for emerging technologies to analyze tumor and cell-free DNA and will provide insights into the mechanisms underpinning treatment resistance in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. The DP2 New Innovator Award will allow us to explore high-risk, high-reward research into how multiomic (genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic) information can be exploited from liquid biopsies to improve clinical applications and precision oncology.
