We are very grateful to the [NCI](https://www.cancer.gov/) for supporting Dr. Gavin Ha with the [2022 NIH Director's New Innovator Award](https://commonfund.nih.gov/newinnovator/AwardRecipients){:target="_blank"}. The DP2 New Innovator Award will support the Ha Lab for the next 5 years to explore high-risk, high-reward research into how multiomic (genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic) information can be exploited from liquid biopsies to improve clinical applications and precision oncology.
