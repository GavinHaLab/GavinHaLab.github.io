[Samantha Schuster](/people/postdoc/Samantha-Schuster) is awarded a Fred Hutch Translational Data Science Postdoc Fellowship. This is two-year award, which will provide funding support for her salary and research. Samantha joined the Ha Lab in February 2024 as a postdoc jointly mentored by [Gavin Ha](/people/Gavin-Ha/) and [Dr. Andrew Hsieh](https://research.fredhutch.org/hsieh/en.html){:target="_blank"}. Her research is focused on studying the tumor heterogeneity and evolution in advanced bladder cancer from whole genome sequencing, circulating tumor DNA, and single-cell RNAseq analyses. She is also investigating the mechansims of resistance to therapies, such cisplatin chemotherapy, and their differences between histological subtypes. The outcome of this work will characterize the advanced bladder cancer to improve our understanding of why rare subtypes are more aggressive with poorer outcomes.
