The labs of [Gavin Ha](/) and [David MacPherson](https://research.fredhutch.org/macpherson/en.html){:target="_blank"} receive a 3-year grant from the [Kuni Foundation](https://www.kunifoundation.org/){:target="_blank"} to develop lung cancer diagnostics for subtyping and predicting response to novel treatments using innovative methods to analyze cell-free DNA. The outcome of this work will have great potential to both guide cancer treatment decisions and to enable early lung cancer detection. We are grateful to the Kuni Foundation for their generous support of our pursuit to improve the lives of patients with lung cancer.
