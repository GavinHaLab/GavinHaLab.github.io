[Anat Zimmer](/people/Anat-Zimmer/) is a new postdoctoral fellow in the lab. She received her PhD in computational biology at the Weizmann Institute before joining the ISB in Seattle. Now, in the Ha lab, she will work on cell-free DNA projects including development of new computational methods to study treatment response in patients with cancer.

[Patty Galipeau](/people/Patricia-Galipeau/) joins the lab as a Research Project Manager overseeing the experimental wet lab operations and provide management support for the lab's overall research program and collaborations. We are excited to have Patty bring her wealth of management, research experience, and leadership to help drive forward our mission.
