The Ha lab is awarded a CDMRP Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Research Program Idea Development Award to develop innovative approaches using cell-free DNA. This is a 3 year grant which we propose to develop new algorithms to study different layers of the cellular machinery that regulates genes using standard sequencing of ctDNA molecules. By employing machine learning techniques, we will combine different strategies of analyzing of cell-free data to classify the tumor subtypes and to identify tumor changes when treatments fail.
