[Pushpa Itagi](/people/Pushpa-Itagi/) is awarded a Fred Hutch Translational Data Science Postdoc Fellowship, which will provide funding support for her salary and research. Pushpa proposed to work on elucidating metastatic bladder cancer (mBLCA) evolution from rapid autopsy tissue samples. She will use statistical and machine learning methods to decipher cancer spread from the bladder to distant tissues. Using a combination of other data types such as methylation, expression, and cell-free DNA from the patients she intends to provide an extensive multi-comics characterization for mBLCA tumor heterogeneity. Pushpa is jointly mentored by [Dr. Andrew Hsieh](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/hsieh-andrew.html){:target="_blank"}. She interface with other key collaborators in the Bladder Cancer Groups at Fred Hutch and UW.
