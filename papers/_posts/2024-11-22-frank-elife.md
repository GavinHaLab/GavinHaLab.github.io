Genomic loss of the transcriptional kinase CDK12 occurs in âˆ¼6% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC) and correlates with poor patient outcomes. Prior studies demonstrate that acute CDK12 loss confers a homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRd) phenotype via premature intronic polyadenylation (IPA) of key HR pathway genes, including ATM. However, mCRPC patients have not demonstrated benefit from therapies that exploit HRd such as inhibitors of polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Based on this discordance, we sought to test the hypothesis that an HRd phenotype is primarily a consequence of acute CDK12 loss and the effect is greatly diminished in prostate cancers adapted to CDK12 loss. Analyses of whole genome sequences (WGS) and RNA sequences (RNAseq) of human mCRPCs determined that tumors with biallelic CDK12 alterations (CDK12BAL) lack genomic scar signatures indicative of HRd, despite carrying bi-allelic loss and the appearance of the hallmark tandem-duplicator phenotype (TDP). Experiments confirmed that acute CDK12 inhibition resulted in aberrant polyadenylation and downregulation of long genes (including BRCA1 and BRCA2) but such effects were modest or absent in tumors adapted to chronic CDK12BAL. One key exception was ATM, which did retain transcript shortening and reduced protein expression in the adapted CDK12BAL models. However, CDK12BALcells demonstrated intact HR as measured by RAD51 foci formation following irradiation. CDK12BAL cells showed a vulnerability to targeting of CDK13 by sgRNA or CDK12/13 inhibitors and in vivo treatment of prostate cancer xenograft lines showed that tumors with CDK12BALresponded to the CDK12/13 inhibitor SR4835, while CDK12-intact lines did not. Collectively, these studies show that aberrant polyadenylation and long HR gene downregulation is primarily a consequence of acute CDK12 deficiency, which is largely compensated for in cells that have adapted to CDK12 loss. These results provide an explanation for why PARPi monotherapy has thus far failed to consistently benefit patients with CDK12 alterations, though alternate therapies that target CDK13 or transcription are candidates for future research and testing.
