# Abstract

OBJECTIVE:
Liquid biopsies are being rapidly used in adult cancers as new biomarkers of disease. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels have been reported to be proportional to disease burden, correlate with treatment response, and predict relapse. However, little is known about how frequently ctDNA is detectable in pediatric patients with solid tumors. Therefore, we developed a next-generation sequencing approach to detect and quantify ctDNA in the blood of patients with the most common pediatric solid tumors.

METHODS:
Detection of ctDNA requires assays sensitive to somatic events typically observed in the cancer type being studied. In pediatric solid tumors, structural variants are more common than recurrent point mutations. We adapted an ultralow passage whole-genome sequencing approach to capture copy number variants and a hybrid capture sequencing assay to detect translocations in liquid biopsy samples from pediatric patients.

RESULTS:
Copy number changes seen by ultralow passage whole-genome sequencing enabled detection of ctDNA in patients with osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and Wilms tumor. In Ewing sarcoma, detection of the EWSR1 translocation was a more sensitive approach. For patients with samples collected at multiple time points, changes in ctDNA levels corresponded to treatment response. We also found that disease-specific genomic biomarkers of prognosis were detectable in ctDNA.

CONCLUSION:
This study demonstrates that liquid biopsy approaches that detect somatic structural variants are well suited to pediatric solid tumors. We show that children with the most common solid tumor malignancies have detectable levels of ctDNA, which may be used to track disease response and identify genomic subclassifiers of disease. Efforts to profile larger collections of clinically annotated specimens are under way to validate the clinical use of these assays.
