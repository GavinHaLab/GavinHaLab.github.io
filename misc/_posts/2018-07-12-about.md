## The Ha Lab

Our laboratory studies is interested in studying the role of genomic alterations in cancer progression and using this knowledge to expand applications for precision medicine. In particular, we are interested in understanding the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in advanced (metastatic) cancers. We develop and apply computational approaches to study tumor genomes from patients with cancer. We also use liquid biopsies, such as cell-free DNA from blood plasma, to study cancer genomes from the circulation and to develop new approaches for potential applications in clinical precision medicine. 
	
### Location
 
The lab is located in Seattle at the [Fred Hutch](http://www.fredhutch.org/). We are in the [Computational Biology Program](http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs/projects/herbold-computational-biology-program.html) and [Public Health Sciences](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs.html). 

### Website

This website was built by cloning and modifying a site originally designed and constructed by my Fred Hutch colleague <strong>Trevor Bedford</strong> ([bedford.io](http://bedford.io)). Some of the site layout is inspired from the website of my former graduate lab ([shahlab.ca](http://shahlab.ca/)).
