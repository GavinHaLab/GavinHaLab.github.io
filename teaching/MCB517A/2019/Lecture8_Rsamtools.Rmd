# 1. Load and query a BAM file

## 1.0 Install and load the `Rsamtools` Bioconductor package
Bioconductor package providing functions to interface with aligned BAM files.
https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rsamtools.html

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#BiocManager::install("Rsamtools")
library(Rsamtools)
```

## 1.1 Loading a BAM file using Rsamtools
The BAM file is the primary input for Rsamtools. There are two initial steps: 

  * a. Define the genomic coordinates and components to query (`ScanBamParam`)
  * b. Scan the BAM file (`scanBam`)

For this tutorial, we will be using the same data and example from Lecture 7: Slides 12-16.
The BAM file can be downloaded at: 

For more information, refer to https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Rsamtools/inst/doc/Rsamtools-Overview.pdf

## 1.2 Setup parameters for scanning BAM file
a. Specify the genomic location of interest to query in the BAM file. This will make use of two of the packages (`GRanges` and `IRanges`) that we will describe in more detail later.
```{r}
whichRanges1 <- GRanges(seqnames = "17", 
                        IRanges(start = 37844393, end = 37844393), myCol = "moreInfo1")
whichRanges2 <- GRanges(seqnames = "17", 
                        IRanges(start = 37844477, end = 37844477), myCol = "moreInfo2")
whichRanges <- append(whichRanges1, whichRanges2)
whichRanges
```

b. Specify which fields to return in the query. To find out the default fields to return, use 
```{r}
whatFields <- scanBamWhat()
whatFields
```

c. Specify the filters to use to include or exclude reads. This is an essential concept in analyzing sequence data. 

> First, specify the status of the reads based on the `FLAG` (recall Lecture 7: Slide 16)
For more details, use `?scanBamFlag`

```{r}
flag <- scanBamFlag(isDuplicate = FALSE)
flag
```

>Next, specify additional filters to use including `mapqFilter`, `tagFilter`. These are included in the final `scanBamParam` object instantiation, along with all the previous arguments.

```{r}
param <- ScanBamParam(which = whichRanges, what = whatFields,  
             mapqFilter = 30, tag = c("RG"))
param
```

## 1.3 Query the BAM file
Using the params we just defined, we will query the BAM file `BRCA_IDC_cfDNA.bam`. 
```{r}
bamFile <- "BRCA_IDC_cfDNA.bam"
bam <- scanBam(bamFile, param = param)
bam
```

This returns a `list` object with each element representing a read. For each element/read, there is another `list` with the fields in the BAM file we requested with `scanBamWhat()`. Here is a breakdown of what is in the first read. 
Refer to Lecture 7: Slides 16-17.
```{r}
bam[[1]]$qname # reqd query name
bam[[1]]$flag  # bitwise flag describing the read alignment
bam[[1]]$rname # reference sequence name
bam[[1]]$pos   # position of aligned read (leftmost coordinate)
bam[[1]]$mapq  # mapping quality of the read alignment
bam[[1]]$cigar # CIGAR string
bam[[1]]$mrnm  # mate read's reference sequence name
bam[[1]]$mpos  # mate read's aligned position
bam[[1]]$isize # insert size or templent length; aka fragment size
as.character(bam[[1]]$seq)   # sequence of mapped reads on forward strand
as.character(bam[[1]]$qual)  # base qualities of the sequence aligment
bam[[1]]$tag   # value for the tag we specified
```

Note: `isize` or `TLEN` equals the number of bases from the leftmost mapped base to the rightmost mapped base. The leftmost mate read has a plus sign and the rightmost has a minus sign for pairs mapping to the same chromosome. 


# 2. Compute "Pile-Up" Statistics
The pileup is a term referring to counting the alleles from all the reads at a given genomic locus. It is the data that many variant and mutation calling algorithms use to determine variant status and allelic fractions.

There are 3 steps:

* a. Define the genomic coordinates and read components to query (`ScanBamParam`) - same as before
* b. Define the pileup-specific parameters, such as filters (`PileupParam`)
* c. Run the `pileup` command

## 3.1 Setup pileup parameters and generate pileup
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Rsamtools/versions/1.24.0/topics/pileup
```{r}
pu.param <- PileupParam() # default settings
pu.param
```


```{r}
pu <- pileup(file = bamFile, scanBamParam = param, pileupParam = pu.param) 
pu
```

The `pileup` command outputs a `data.frame` object containing the counts for each allele at every base specified in `param` from `2.1 Setup parameters for scanning BAM file`

Let's try generating the pileup for more loci and reads
```{r}
whichRanges3 <- GRanges(seqnames = "17", 
                        IRanges(start = 37883255, end = 37883260), myCol = "moreInfo2")
bamWhich(param) <- whichRanges3
pileup(file = bamFile, scanBamParam = param, pileupParam = pu.param) 
```
