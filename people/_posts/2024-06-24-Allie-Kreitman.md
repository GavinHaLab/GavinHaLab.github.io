I am a PhD rotation student in the UW MD/PhD program, conducting research with the Ha lab. My focus is on utilizing genomics to explore the mechanisms of how metastasis are seeded. 

Previously, I earned a B.A. in Molecular Biology from Colorado College in 2021, where my honors thesis investigated the mechanisms by which Epstein Barr Virus promotes B cell lymphoma formation. Following graduation, I conducted research with Dr. Elodie Ghedin at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, studying genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the international spread of viral lineages. 

Outside of the lab, I love doing anything outdoors from reading in the sun to rock climbing, hiking, and backpacking.
