I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Fred Hutch working in the Computational Biology Program. I joined Dr. Gavin Ha’s Lab in October 2020, with co-mentorship under Dr. Peter Nelson. My aim is to develop my skills in computational biology and bioinformatics while transitioning into more translational research with cancer therapies.

As an undergrad I conducted Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) experimental physics research under Dr. Gregory Lafyatis at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. At that time, I was constructing and operating optical tweezers and multi-photon lithography devices, which first brought me into contact with biological research. In 2015 I began my Ph.D. work, also at [OSU](https://www.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, and moved into Dr. Ralf Bundschuh’s group studying theoretical biophysics. There I collaborated extensively with Dr. Guramrit Singh’s group in the molecular genetics department and helped demonstrate the existence of two distinct forms of the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) and their unique roles. In the fall of 2020, mid-pandemic, I graduated OSU and moved from my hometown of Columbus, Ohio to Seattle to begin my work at the Hutch.

In my free time I love to powerlift, read, sing, and travel. I look forward to exploring all the wonderful nature in the PNW!
