I am an incoming MD/PhD student at the University of Washington and a summer rotation student. My projects in the Ha lab revolve around adapting and leveraging existing computational methods to identify transcription factor binding site activity in metastatic breast cancer. Originally from Seattle, I graduated from [Barnard College](https://barnard.edu/){:target="_blank"} in New York, NY in 2018 with a major in Cellular and Molecular Biology. As an undergrad, I worked in Laura Johnstonâ€™s group at the Columbia University Medical Center investigating the role of Toll-signaling during phenomenon known as cell competition. After graduating, I returned to Seattle where I contributed to projects analyzing the innate immune response to Zika virus as a research technician in the [Overbaugh lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/overbaugh/en.html){:target="_blank"} at Fred Hutch. 

With my free time, I enjoy reading, playing cards, and rock climbing.
