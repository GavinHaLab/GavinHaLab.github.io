I am a 1st year Master’s student studying Data Science at the University of Washington, working as a research assistant in the Ha Lab as part of the Genomics Research Training for Data Scientists (GRTDS) program. I graduated from the University of Michigan with a BSE in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Statistics.

In my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant in the Sienko Research Lab investigating the use of wearable sensor data (ECG and IMU) in balance rehabilitation and distance running applications. I also spent a summer interning at Medtronic, where I developed deep learning algorithms for heart arrhythmia classification.

As a Master’s student in Data Science, I look forward to developing a strong foundation of data science skills, as well as deepening my knowledge of machine learning and AI algorithms. In the Ha Lab, I am excited for the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in applying deep learning algorithms towards meaningful work in studying cancer and advancing precision medicine.

Beyond academics, I am an avid outdoor enthusiast, and enjoy skiing, cycling, and hiking, and am excited to explore all that the PNW has to offer.
