I am Yixin Lin, a visiting PhD student from Denmark, and I will be working in the Ha lab for 6 months. I am currently in my second year at [Aarhus University, Denmark](https://international.au.dk/){:target="_blank"}. My [projects](https://www.moma.dk/bioinformatics/computational-genomics){:target="_blank"} mainly focus on variant calling of ctDNA single nucleotide variations, including both variant caller benchmarking on deep-targeted UMI-seq data and developing a new variant caller to detect low-frequency point mutations in WGS data with high precision.

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from Nankai University, China, where I studied biological science. However, I soon discovered a stronger interest in computational biology, prompting me to pursue a Master's degree in bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. For my PhD studies, I chose to join Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital to gain more clinical exposure.

In my free time, I have a passion for K-pop music, cooking, playing badminton, skiing, and SUP.
