 I am a 4th year undergraduate at the University of Washington majoring in MCD biology and biochemistry. I am working with [Dr. Pushpa Itagi](/people/postdoc/pushpa-itagi) to analyze genomics data collected through rapid autopsy of bladder cancer patients to understand tumor evolution in advanced bladder cancer. In the fall, I will be attending graduate school for a PhD in human genetics. Outside of the lab, I enjoy binge-reading webcomics and trying out free trials of fitness classes with my roommates.
