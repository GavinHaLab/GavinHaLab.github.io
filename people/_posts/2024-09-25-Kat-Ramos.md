I am a rotating graduate student in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Program at University of Washington. I am broadly interested in investigating the role of the human microbiome in host health. 
 
I received my B.S. in Microbiology at University of California, San Diego in June of 2022. During my undergraduate studies, I worked at Garage Brewing Co as a laboratory assistant to develop and maintain quality assurance protocols. I next joined the Dutton Lab, where we used cheese rind microbiomes as a model system for investigating microbial community dynamics. Following my graduation, I joined the Gibbons Lab at Institute for Systems Biology, where I investigated the role of height on gut microbiome diversity. As part of my rotation project in the Ha lab, I will be leveraging Whole Genome Sequencing data to investigate the microbial communities existing in tumor tissue.
 
In my free time, I love watching movies, hiking, and rollerskating!
