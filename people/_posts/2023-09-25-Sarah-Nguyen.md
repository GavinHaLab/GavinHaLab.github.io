I am a Master student pursuing my degree in Data Science at the University of Washington.

In May of 2022, I graduated with my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering with a concentration of Digital Signal Processing from St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, TX. Post-graduation, I gained valuable experience working as a data scientist in a software factory called LevelUP, where I assisted in the development of a model to identify cyber threat actors and their threat level from unstructured text. This endeavor honed my skills in natural language processing and more specifically, named entity recognition. This experience ignited my passion for data science and motivated me to further my education in Data Science and take a deeper dive into the field.

Now working as a Graduate researcher in the Ha Lab, I will be leveraging deep learning to aid with cancer detection. I hope to gain hands on experience to discover how my passion and skills can help meet some of the worlds needs.

In my free time, I love to explore the outdoors, play pickle ball, bake, and watch reality TV, such as 90 day fiancé.
