I  am a rotation student in the University of Washington’s MCB program. Prior to joining the lab, I spent two years at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland studying the role of RNA in maintaining the integrity of the genome. Before that, I earned  my bachelor's degree in Biochemistry from Case Western Reserve University. My undergraduate thesis involved studying the evolution of non-synonymous codon usage in the influenza genome and the resulting change in predicted RNA stability. 

As a graduate student, I would like to apply computational techniques to improve our understanding of disease. While rotating in the Ha lab, I’m interested in studying the mutational landscape of prostate cancer and its effect on the 3D organization of the genome. 

In  my spare time, I like to rock climb, swim, mountain bike, trail-run, and play guitar.
