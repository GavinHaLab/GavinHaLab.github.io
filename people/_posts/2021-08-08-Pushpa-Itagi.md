I am a post-Doctoral researcher co-mentored by Dr. Gavin Ha and Dr. Andrew Hsieh at the department of Computational Biology, Public Health Sciences division.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on understanding metastatic bladder cancer biology by analyzing genomics data collected through rapid autopsy of bladder cancer patients. I aim to evaluate different types of genomics data and integrate them to elucidate the biology for metastasis. Before joining Fred Hutch, I was a graduate student at the University of Kansas and a graduate researcher at UCLA. I worked with Dr. Eric J. Deeds on understanding prokaryotic proteasome assembly using Molecular Dynamics and Mathematical Modeling approaches.

I am looking forward to learning and growing as a researcher at the Hutch and developing an understanding of metastatic cancer biology.   Besides work, I enjoy hiking, reading, travelling, exploring new places, and cooking.
