I am a Data Scientist at the [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab](https://hutchdatascience.org/){:target="_blank"} where I am primarily a Data Science Instructor. I have taught several hundred Fred Hutch staff and clinicians from first time coders to computational scientists to broaden their skills in biomedical data science. I am passionate in helping folks from all backgrounds to grow their data science skills on the job. Previously, I developed and taught a summer undergraduate program in computational genomics for the [Broad Summer Research Program (BSRP)](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bsrp/broad-summer-research-program-bsrp){:target="_blank"} for two years.
 
My scientific and research background is in biostatistics and cancer genomics. I received my B.A. in Mathematics at Tufts University, and my ScM in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I worked as an Associate Computational Biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in the Blood Biopsy Group, in which I was exposed to cell-free DNA research together with Gavin Ha. I am currently collaborating with the Ha lab in cancer subtype prediction using cell-free DNA.
