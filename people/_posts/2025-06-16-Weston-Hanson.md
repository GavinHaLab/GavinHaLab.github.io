I graduated from Seattle Pacific University this year with a BS in computer science with a minor in biology. 

I have previous research experiences in a variety of areas. At [SPU](https://spu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, I was using computational approaches to study salmon DNA. I also completed an internship last summer at [Institute for Systems Biology](https://isbscience.org/){:target="_blank"} where I worked on tuberculosis. This project involved studying the effects of ROS on a non-pathogenic version of tuberculosis, as well as using computational techniques to create a predictive network of sRNA-mRNA interactions in tuberculosis. 

It has been my dream for a long time to work in cancer research, so I am super excited to join the Ha Lab!
