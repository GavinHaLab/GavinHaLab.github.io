I am a first-year graduate student in the MCB program at the University of Washington. I have a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley, and I conducted my honors thesis research in Dr. Elçin Ünal's lab studying gene regulation during meiosis in budding yeast. After undergrad, I worked at the Altius Institute in Seattle, WA using synthetic transcription factors to enhance T cell function. There, I developed an interest to better understand regulatory regions of the genome and how they pertain to disease. I then moved on to work at Lyell Immunopharma using synthetic and naturally-derived proteins to engineer human T cells for adoptive cell therapy.

Outside of the lab, I like to read, bake, and play golf.
