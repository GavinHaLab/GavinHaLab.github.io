I am a PhD student in Biomedical and Health Informatics at UW rotating in the Ha Lab this summer. Before moving to Seattle, I received a BS in Medical Sciences and MPH in Biostatistics from the University of Cincinnati.

My previous "dry lab" research projects include developing a gene signature predictive of relapse in kidney cancer and proposing novel candidate therapeutics for brain cancer and systemic sclerosis. In prior graduate research rotations, I analyzed single-cell transcriptomics to explore field cancerization and EHR data to identify associations between immunomodulatory drug usage and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the Ha Lab, I will be working to better understand and characterize intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity in metastatic bladder cancer.

Outside of the lab, I usually spend my weekends bouldering, watching football (both kinds), exploring Seattle with friends, and listening to music.
