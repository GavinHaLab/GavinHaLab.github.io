I am a Research Technician (II) in the Ha Lab. I joined the team in late 2023. My role focuses on performing the laboratory procedures and experiments necessary for generating raw data that can then be analyzed with tools created through computational genomics. My responsibilities also include contributing to the management and maintenance required for the safe and reliable operation of the laboratory. 
My previous work spanned a wide range of laboratory experiences in contract research, assay development, sample testing, and biorepository operation. 
My personal interests are movies, art, cooking, current events, politics, motorcycles, biking, mechanical work, and making things.
