I'm a first year medical student at the University of Washington working with the Ha Lab on genomics in liquid biopsy. 
 
Previously, I worked with Dr. William S. Noble at the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences for my PhD in statistics. My projects focused on computational methods for omics data. We worked on developing methods to incorporate prior knowledge into scATAC-seq latent Dirichlet models, and also imputation methods for HiC data. I also collaborated with Dr. Elizabeth Thompson to investigate the impact of linkage disequilibrium on various estimators of heritability in large genome studies, such as the 1000 Genomes Projects.
 
I also enjoy the outdoors and love trail running and biking and swimming!
