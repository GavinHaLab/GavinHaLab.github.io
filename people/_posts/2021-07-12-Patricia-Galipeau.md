I am a Research Project Manager for the Ha Lab at Fred Hutch and I bring 25+ years of research, project, biospecimen, and laboratory management to the team. I lead assay development and wet lab operations, facilitate collaborations, and support our overall research program. I am excited by working in multi-disciplinary research teams in large, longitudinal (epi)genomics projects and bring experience in collection, management, and ethical use of annotated biospecimen in cancer research.  

My prior research under the direction of Dr. Brian J. Reid focused on implementing novel genomics technologies for cancer risk assessment through characterization of temporal-spatial evolution of neoplastic cells before cancer, with specific expertise in clonal evolution of somatic genomic alterations in Barrettâ€™s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. 

I am passionate about leadership development and bring this enthusiasm to our research team. I have completed the [Inner MBA Certificate](https://innermba.soundstrue.com/){:target="_blank"} program, am an [Institute for Generative Leadership Excellence in Generative Leadership](https://generateleadership.com/){:target="_blank"} graduate, and have received a [Gauge Leadership Lab Certification](https://www.shorthandconsulting.com/wp/home/individuals/gauge-leadership-lab/){:target="_blank"}.
 
Outside the lab, I love travel adventures with my family; growing vegetables, fruit, and flowers in my garden at my home on Squak mountain; hiking, biking, skiing, and SCUBA; meditation and mindfulness practices such as shinrin yoku; and reading anything published by Sounds True.
