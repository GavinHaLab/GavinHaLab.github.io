I'm an undergraduate computer science major at Willamette University interning at the Ha Lab in Fred Hutch during the summer of 2023. Through coursework at both Central Washington University and Willamette University, I have developed proficiency in Python, which has been the primary programming language of my studies. 

During my time at Willamette University, I contributed to the creation of a CNN model used to identify skin lesions, which piqued my interest in machine learning and neural networks. I also studied data structures analyzed algorithms used for simple string matching, while learning and gaining experience with working with data as a whole. 

Outside of computer science, I enjoy engaging in sports and outdoor activities. I am a member of the Willamette University track and field team, I enjoy playing soccer, I like hikes and the outdoors in general. I also like to embrace my artistic side from time to time and create drawings and artworks.
