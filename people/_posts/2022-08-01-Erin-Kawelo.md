I graduated from Seattle Pacific University in 2020 with a degree in Cell and molecular biology.  I was previously a research technician at Benaroya research institute in the Cerosaletti lab before coming to the Ha lab.  
I am the Ha labs research technician that focuses on wet lab experiments such as cfDNA extractions from various plasma samples.  
During my free time, I enjoy reading, hanging out with my friends and exploring new coffee shops and restaurants in Seattle.
