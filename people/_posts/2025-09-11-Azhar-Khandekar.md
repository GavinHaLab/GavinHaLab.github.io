I am Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Computational Biology Program at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. Prior to joining the Fred Hutch, I completed my PhD as a joint student with UC San Diego and the National Cancer Institute (NCI, where I was supervised by [Ludmil Alexandrov (UCSD)](https://alexandrov.cloud.ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"} and [Maria Teresa Landi (NCI)](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/landi-maria){:target="_blank"}, after having completed my undergrad at University of Washington (BS Biochemistry) and a post-baccalaureate program also at the NIH.
 
My thesis work involved developing and applying schemas for copy number and structural variant signatures, as well as an in-depth examination of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in lung cancer. Specifically, I provided a robust set of software tools for classifying large-scale genomic alterations and independently lead a multi-omic analysis of the causes and consequences of ecDNA in lung cancer.
 
At Fred Hutch, I am excited to build upon my passion for genomics research in the liquid biopsy space, particularly through the lens of tumor evolution.
 
Outside of work, I love staying active by being outdoors (hiking and cycling) and playing sports. My hobbies include soccer, tennis, sand volleyball, and chess.
