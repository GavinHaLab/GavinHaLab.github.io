I am currently a Senior Data Analyst at the [Seattle Children's Research Institute](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/){:target="_blank"} and an Affiliate of Fred Hutch. In my current position in Logistics and Operations at SCRI, I develop BI solutions and increase data visibility via dashboards, reports, data sets and other constructs in Tableau and Power BI to support research efforts from the administrative side. I also perform analyses for the senior leadership team that focus on strategy and implementation of Lean principles. I received my data science certificate from the [University of Washington](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/data-science){:target="_blank"}.

Prior to my current role, I worked for the Department of Energy (BPA) to advance the integration of renewables into their generation portfolio. This involved project management, operations research and software development. I designed an algorithm for meteorological pattern recognition to increase early warning of severe wind events in the Pacific Northwest region; I also wrote code to automate error detection in financial transactions. Lastly, I worked with senior developers in IT on algorithm design for the allocation of renewable energy credits (RECs).

I received a BA in physics from [Whitman College](https://www.whitman.edu/){:target="_blank"} and an MS in physics from [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My graduate research focused on quantum (nonlinear) optics, specifically optimizing second harmonic generation in photonic crystals for peak efficiency and photon entanglement. As an undergraduate I had the privilege of receiving a research internship from the [Space Grant Consortium](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/national/spacegrant/about/index.html){:target="_blank"} and worked at [NASAâ€™s JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/){:target="_blank"} campus. My work focused on finding empirical relationships for the probability of circuit board failure due to electrostatic discharge during deep space missions.

In my free time I enjoy reading classic science fiction, keeping current on Mayan archaeology and traveling with my wife and toddler.
