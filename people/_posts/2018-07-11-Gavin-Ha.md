I am an *Assistant Professor* at the [Fred Hutch](http://www.fredhutch.org/){:target="_blank"} in the [Computational Biology Program](http://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs/projects/herbold-computational-biology-program.html){:target="_blank"} and [Public Health Sciences Division](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs.html). I joined the faculty starting in July of 2018. I am also an *Affiliate Assistant Professor* in the [Department of Genome Sciences](http://www.gs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Washington.

I received my BSc in [Microbiology & Immunology](https://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"} and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"} from the University of British Columbia ([UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}) in 2008. In 2014, I completed a PhD in Bioinformatics from the [Bioinformatics Training Program](http://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"} at UBC, while working at the [BC Cancer Agency](http://www.bccrc.ca/){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of [Dr. Sohrab Shah](http://shahlab.ca/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Sam Aparicio](http://molonc.bccrc.ca/aparicio-lab/){:target="_blank"}. In my doctoral work, I developed computational algorithms using Bayesian and machine learning approaches to analyze cancer genome data. I applied these methods to help uncover new insights into the aberrant genomes of ovarian and breast cancer. These contributions led to the Lloyd Skarsgard Graduate Research Excellence Award for most outstanding PhD research at the BC Cancer Agency. 

I then joined the laboratory of [Dr. Matthew Meyerson](http://meyersonlab.dana-farber.org/){:target="_blank"} at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institue of MIT & Harvard as a postdoctoral fellow. Here, I worked on developing computational methods for analyzing long-range DNA sequencing technologies Using these approaches, we discovered novel non-coding alterations containing enhancers of the androgen receptor gene in metastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, I was instrumental in establishing a scalable workflow to study genomes and exomes of cell-free DNA from liquid biopsies. 

Outside of science, I enjoy spending time with my family. I have 2 daughters, a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old. In my free time, my hobbies include playing volleyball and powerlifting. I am also a sports fan and follow tennis, F1, hockey and basketball.
