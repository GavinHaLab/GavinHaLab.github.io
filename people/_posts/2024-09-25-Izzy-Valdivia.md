I am currently a Master student at University of Washington working towards a degree in Data Science.
 
I completed my Bachelor's degree in May 2022 from Macalester College (St. Paul, MN) where I majored in computer science and minored in math and data science. During undergrad, I had the opportunity to complete a project that explored the connection between accessibility and AI by developing a hands-free digital art application using computer vision techniques. After graduation I worked at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minnesota as a data scientist. My role focused on member enrollment trend analysis as well as a project that explored ways to close Medicaid care access gaps in rural Minnesota.
 
I'm looking forward to sharpening my skills as a data scientist in my graduate program and applying those skills to help enable the important work being done in the Ha lab.
 
Outside of work, I enjoy knitting, running, paddle-boarding & gluten free baking!
