I have two master’s degrees in Life Science from Ewha Womans University and in Computer Science from the University of Toronto, where I studied machine learning in computational biology lab under the supervision of Dr. Fritz Roth. 

I worked at Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) as a bioinformatician. My work focused on feature improvement for the quality of synthetic tumor simulation using the BAMsurgeon tool. At Columbia University Medical Center, as a data analyst,  I implemented and improved cancer panel pipeline with fusion gene analysis.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and traveling together. I’m also following basketball and I'm a big fan of Toronto Raptors.
