I am currently a graduate student at Harvard University pursuing a Master's in [Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I recently graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in [Bioengineering](https://bioe.uw.edu/){:target="_blank"} and a minor in Applied Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research at Seattle Childrenâ€™s Research Institute, where I worked towards integrating machine learning and epigenomics to interpret genetic variants in the context of degenerative retinal disorders.

My project in the Ha lab focuses on investigating the role of complex structural rearrangements in cancer genomes. I am excited to continue learning about the applications of computational methods to biomedical research.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin and exploring new coffee shops.
