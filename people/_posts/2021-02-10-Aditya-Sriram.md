I am currently a first-year Masters student in the Genetic Epidemiology program at the University of Washington. I graduated with a B.S. in Genetics and Genomics from the University of California, Davis. 
 
As an undergrad student, I joined Dr. Megan Dennisâ€™s lab and studied the impact of point mutations in autism spectrum disorder disease pathways using zebrafish as a model. Additionally, in the summer of 2019 I worked with Dr. Su Guo at the University of California, San Francisco to analyze differential gene expression in corticotropin-releasing hormone b (crhb) expressing cells. These research experiences helped me gain an appreciation for both wet-lab genetics research as well as computationally-driven genomics work such as single-cell RNA sequencing, visualizing expression data, and implementing clustering algorithms.
 
In graduate school, I hope to apply and further my knowledge in genetics and genomics in both computational approaches and epidemiological contexts. As a member of the Ha Lab, I will be doing gene expression analysis of circulating tumor DNA from pediatric neuroblastoma in collaboration with Dr. Brian Compton from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 
 
In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, producing music, and exploring new coffee shops.
