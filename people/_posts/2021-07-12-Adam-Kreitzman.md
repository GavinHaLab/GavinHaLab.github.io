I recently graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a double major in Data Science and Mathematics with a specialization in Probability and Statistics, and I will be joining the fall 2022 cohort of the Masters in Information and Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

My work in the lab specializes in novel deep-learning methods for detecting copy-number changes along the DNA to create cancer diagnostics and tumor fraction predictors.

In my free time, I love playing volleyball, playing with my puppy and watching the 49ers and Warriors bring championships to the Bay Area.
