I am an undergraduate student at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I am double-majoring in Data Science and Mathematics with a specialization in Probability and Statistics. I look forward to exploring the fascinating cross-section of biology and machine learning in the Ha lab, specifically using computational methods to improve cancer detection through cell-free DNA.
