I am a Bioinformatics Analyst in the Ha Lab at Fred Hutch, and joined in July of 2023. I attended the University of Oregon for my undergraduate and graduate studies, obtaining a bachelor's degree in Biology with emphases in Neuroscience and Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Biology and a minor in Chemistry in 2021, as well as a master's degree in Bioinformatics and Genomics in 2022. During graduate school, I contributed to a research project in collaboration with Salish Bioscience to develop a fit-for-purpose bioinformatics pipeline for the detection of low-frequency variants in cell-free DNA sequencing data. I continued my work with Salish as an intern, and later, as an associate bioinformatics scientist, and developed bioinformatic tools to aid in the early diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer via liquid biopsy.

 
I am passionate about contributing to research that has the potential to improve cancer patient outcomes, and have found research surrounding cell-free DNA to be exceptionally exciting and promising. In my free time, I enjoy reading historical fiction, cooking, and riding my bike.
