I am Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Computational Biology Program at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. My research interests are in developing novel computational methods for the analysis of cell-free DNA as a minimally invasive blood-based biomarker.  The aim of such methods will provide a deeper understanding of cancer evolution and better monitor the dynamics of tumor evolution under treatment pressures to help guide patients and clinicians to the most safe and effective therapies. 

Prior to joining Fred Hutch, I completed my undergraduate and master’s studies in Mathematics (BS) and Applied Mathematics (MS) at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I then went on to pursue a PhD in [Biostatistics at Georgetown University](https://biostatistics.georgetown.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Under the co-mentorship of Drs. Jaeil Ahn and Anton Wellstein, my thesis research developed computational methods for the analysis of cell-type specific DNA methylation patterns to estimate the relative contributions of individual cell and tissue types to cell-free DNA content in “liquid biopsy” samples. Changes in cell-free DNA composition over time were used to discern altered cellular contributions reflective of disease state, tissue specific damage, and treatment related adverse events in multiple clinical application areas. I am excited to continue my research in the cell-free DNA and liquid biopsy space at Fred Hutch, expanding my computational skillset and focusing deeper on cancer biology. 

Outside of work I love to spend my time outdoors, usually doing some form of swimming, biking, and running.
