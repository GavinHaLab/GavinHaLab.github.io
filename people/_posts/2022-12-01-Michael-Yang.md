I am currently a Bioinformatics Analyst in the Ha Lab at Fred Hutch. I recently graduated from Columbia University with a master’s in Biomedical Engineering, specializing in bioinformatics and data science. Before that, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Bioengineering and a minor in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I joined Dr. Gavin Ha’s Lab in December 2022.

My work in the lab is as a bioinformatics analyst, focusing on informatics analysis, data management, and pipeline development for workflows in detecting copy number changes and other mutations to improve cancer diagnostics and understand tumor evolution. I have previously conducted academic research in cell and tissue engineering, microfluidics, and bioinformatics, as well as projects in companies such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Illumina.

In my free time, I like to hike, play the piano, and build model kits. Coming from New York, I am currently also attempting to learn skiing, snowboarding, and other outdoor activities available in Seattle.
