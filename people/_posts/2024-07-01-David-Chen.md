I am a medical student at the University of Washington School of Medicine. I graduated from Duke University with a bachelor's in biology and computer science. While in college, I pursued research in the topics of developmental biology, genetics, innate immunity, and viral epidemiology. I also have software engineering experience in web app development and cloud infrastructure.

I am interested in combining my love for medicine, programming, and research. I am considering specializing in medical oncology in part because I see so much future potential in the field. In the Ha lab, I am looking forward to learning and applying computational tools to cancer genomics in cell free DNA. I aim to use this data to help improve cancer detection and inform clinical decision making.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy outdoor exercise, rock climbing, video games, and watching basketball.
