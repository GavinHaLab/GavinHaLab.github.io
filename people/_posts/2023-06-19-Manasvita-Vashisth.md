I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Computational Biology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. I am interested in developing novel computational methods for analyzing cell free DNA and ctDNA for early cancer diagnosis and tracking tumor phenotype evolution in patients.
 
I received my undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Bioengineering. During my undergrad I worked on multiple research projects including a computational model for liver metabolism at IIT Bombay, developing liposome encapsulation for drug delivery at NTU, Singapore etc. I did my Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. My thesis work involved studying the role of nuclear intermediate filaments (lamins) in proliferating cells i.e., embryonic cells and cancer cells. I trained in wet lab techniques to study the role of Lamin A in providing mechanoprotection against nuclear rupture and cell cycle arrest in embryonic hearts. I also developed computational techniques (e.g., scaling informed machine learning) to analyze DNA, RNA and proteomics data from cancer patients to identify gene-promoter relationships and identify biomarkers to predict survival in cancer patients. At Fred Hutch, I hope to develop computational biology techniques for ctDNA analysis that would enable the relatively easier to obtain liquid biopsies to detect cancer early or detect changes in the cancer phenotype of already diagnosed patients.
 
In my free time I like to hike, play tennis and strategy board games.
